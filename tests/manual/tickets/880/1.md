## Renderer - Infinite selectionChange event

1. Focus editor.
1. Place selection like `This is {an <strong>editor}</strong> instance.` (must end on the end of inline style)

**Expected**: Every time selection is changed, console log with `selectionChangeDone` is printed once.
While creating selection from **2.**, there might be `renderer-selection-similar` warning visible in the console.
