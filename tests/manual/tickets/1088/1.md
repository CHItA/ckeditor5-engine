## Stripping disallowed attributes by `(insert|delete)Content` [#1088](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/issues/1088)

### Simple scenario.

1. Copy a paragraph with italic and link.
2. Paste it to the Heading 1. Inserted text should have only an italic style.
3. Paste it to the Heading 2. Inserted text should have only a link.
4. Paste it to the Heading 3. Inserted text should be fully stripped.

### Nested nodes.

1. Copy a list item with bold and link.
2. Paste it into the empty block (just under the Heading 2). Inserted list item should have a bold style a link.
2. Paste it into the empty block in BlockQuote. Inserted list item should be fully stripped.

### Auto paragraphing.

1. Copy a text with bold.
2. Select all content in the editor.
3. Paste copied text. Inserted content should be a paragraph and should be stripped from bold.
